    # This role forces the installation of python2, which breaks any
    # pip modules that are installed afterwards because Ansible will
    # see that /usr/bin/python exists and use it.  In particular,
    # Ansible will try to install python-apt during idempotence; since
    # this package does not exist in Debian 11 (Bullseye) that causes
    # Ansible to fail.
    #
    # I have created aws/efs-utils#57 to encourage the good folks at
    # aws/efs-utils to support python3 in their packaging.  (The code
    # itself already supports python3.)  Until they change that, this
    # role is the last thing that Ansible installs.
